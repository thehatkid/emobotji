A **Text-to-Emoji** Bot for Discord.

**Emobotji** lets You use emotes by using "text-to-emoji" (`:name_of_emoji:`)
even without Discord Nitro.

Once you've found an name of emoji you'd like to use, just send it as if you
were sending a regular Discord emoji (e.g. `:pog:`, `;troll;`).
It will be detected if there is such in bot.
Using semicolons (`;thonk;`)is also supported.

You can add emojis (if have Nitro) from server or from URL with PNG, JPEG or
GIF image to Bot and use it for further using.
(`e!add <name> <discord emoji>` or `e!add-from-url <name> <url with media>`)

Also You can find some interesting emojis in emojis list: `e!list [<page of list>]`

Want find favorite emoji? `e!search <name_or_word>`

**Notice:** You can't invite right now Emobotji to your Discord Server, the bot is
currently on 100 servers when the <u>bot is not verified by Discord</u>.
