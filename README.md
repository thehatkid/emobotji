A Text-to-Emoji Bot for Discord. :yeah:

This bot same as [Emote Collector](https://github.com/EmoteBot/EmoteCollector), but eaiser to host

Emobotji lets you use emotes you don't have by using "text-to-emoji" `:name_of_emoji:` even without Nitro.

Once you've found an emoji you'd like to use, just send it as if you were sending a regular Discord emoji (e.g. `:hueh:`). It will be detected if there is such a bot and sent by the bot. Using semicolons (`;thonk;`) is also supported.

Also You can find some interesting emojis in emojis list. `e!list [<page of list>]`
